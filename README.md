# Real-Time-3D-Body-Scanning-for-Custom-Clothing

### Project Overview

The fashion and retail industries are increasingly embracing technology to offer personalized experiences to customers. This project proposes the development of a real-time 3D body scanning system to enable custom clothing fitting. By using advanced iterative image reconstruction techniques, similar to those employed in CBCT imaging, the system will create highly accurate 3D models of customers' bodies. These models can be used to generate tailor-made clothing recommendations, ensuring a perfect fit every time.


### Project Goals
##### 1. Accurate 3D Body Scanning: 
###### Develop algorithms to reconstruct the customer's body in 3D with high precision, capturing exact measurements and contours.
##### 2. Real-Time Processing: 
###### Ensure the system can process and display the 3D model in real-time, allowing customers to see the fit of clothing virtually.
##### 3. Customization Options: 
###### Integrate tools for customers to customize clothing based on the 3D model, such as adjusting sleeve lengths, fabric types, and patterns.
##### 4. User-Friendly Interface: 
###### Design an intuitive interface that makes the scanning process simple and engaging for users in retail environments.
##### 5. Data Security: 
###### Implement robust privacy and security measures to protect users' body data.

### Project Structure
The project will consist of the following components:

    data_acquisition.py: Module for capturing depth and RGB data of the customerâ€™s body using a 3D scanner.
    image_processing.py: Module for processing the captured data and extracting relevant features for reconstruction.
    3d_reconstruction.py: Core module for reconstructing the 3D body model using iterative image reconstruction techniques.
    customization_interface.py: Interface for users to customize clothing options based on their 3D model.
    rendering_engine.py: Handles the real-time rendering of the 3D body model with virtual clothing applied.
    data_security.py: Ensures the security and privacy of the customer's body data.
